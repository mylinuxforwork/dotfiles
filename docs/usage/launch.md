### From Sddm

The recommended way to launch the ML4W Dotfiles for Hyprland is with the Display Manager sddm.

The Dotfiles installation script will offer to install the display manager [SDDM](https://github.com/sddm/sddm) & a configuration for the SDDM theme [sdd-sugar-candy](https://github.com/Kangie/sddm-sugar-candy).

With the Hyprland settings script you can copy the current wallpaper into SDDM and use it as a background.

### From TTY

You can also start Hyprland from the command line with

```sh
# Start Hyprland
Hyprland
```

You can install a custom tty login issue (layout) with the Dotfiles installer or later with the ML4W Welcome App.

Please check the troubleshooting section in case of issues.
