You can also start the Welcome App from the terminal with 

```sh

```
The welcome screen includes the most important keybindings to open a terminal or a browser.

You can start the ML4W Welcome App by clicking on the L icon on the right side in waybar, using the rofi application launcher or by typing ml4w in your terminal (if you're using the .bashrc from the dotfiles).
