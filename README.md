## Recommendation

I recommend to install a base Hyprland system before installing the ML4W Hyprland Dotfiles. Then you have a stable starting point and can test Hyprland on your system before. Hyprland is complex, under ongoing development and requires additional components. 

You can find the Hyprland Installation instructions here: https://wiki.hyprland.org/Getting-Started/Installation/

## Installation

The installation should work on all Arch Linux and Fedora based distributions (>2.9.7.0). [You can find more information here](https://github.com/mylinuxforwork/dotfiles/wiki).

> PLEASE NOTE: Every Linux distribution, setup and personal configuration can be different. Therefore, I cannot guarantee that the ML4W Dotfiles will work everywhere. You can install this at your own risk.

Please make sure that your system is up-to-date.

### Arch Linux (based)

IMPORTANT: Please make sure that all your system and packages are updated before running the installation script.

```
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mylinuxforwork/dotfiles/main/setup-arch.sh)
```
