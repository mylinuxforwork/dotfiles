This is one of my first attempts at using Git and submitting a pull request,  
so please excuse any rough edges in the code or commit structure.

Changes I made:
- Switched to a pixel-style font for a retro and cleaner appearance.
- Added transparency to modules to blend better with the wallpaper.
- Removed unused/extra modules to keep the bar minimal and focused.
- Switched to a monochrome color scheme for a more strict and clean style.
- Added a wallpapers folder to match the new look.

Screenshot attached for a quick preview of the result.
